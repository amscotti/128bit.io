Summary: Preparing for a 22-hour flight to New Zealand and Australia by loading up on ebooks from ThriftEBooks. Focusing on Manning Publications' "Groovy in Action" and "Grails in Action" to gain expertise for demonstrating rapid web application development with Grails at work.

So looking over the times for my flight it seems that it takes about 22 hours to get to New Zealand from Boston and about the same to get back from Australia. 22 hours is a long time to be in one place....Well, not really one place, but sitting.

So thanks to the great site, [http://www.thriftebook.com](http://www.thriftebook.com/) I been loading up on ebooks to read on the trip. The 2 books I'm really looking forward to reading are [Groovy in Action](http://www.manning.com/koenig) and [Grails in Action](http://www.manning.com/gsmith/) both from [Manning Publications Co.](http://www.manning.com/) I'm hoping I can get through both of them before getting back as I would like to be able to show some people at work the power and ease of using Grails for web application development.

If anyone knows of other great Groovy, Grails or web application development books, please comment and let me know!
