[Zoë Keating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo%C3%AB_Keating) is an cellist, I would say along the lines of Apocalyptica but more classical, softer and easier to listen to when trying to work. I find her music very soothing and it lets me clear my mind to work out problems.

I stumbled on her music from someone's Twitter posting, after listening to a video _Wired_ made of her playing I went looking on Amazon MP3 to see what I could find. Right now there is only 2 albums on Amazon MP3 and iTunes, but going to her website [http://music.zoekeating.com](http://music.zoekeating.com), you can find all of them for sale in any format you would want.

Here is the video I saw from _Wired_ for Zoë Keating playing "Escape Artist"
