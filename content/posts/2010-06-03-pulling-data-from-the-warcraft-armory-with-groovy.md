title: Pulling data from the Warcraft Armory with Groovy
url: /2010/06/03/pulling-data-from-the-warcraft-armory-with-groovy/

**Update:** New code using Battle.net'sÂ REST API can be found [here]({{< relref "2011-09-22-updated-world-of-warcraft-armory-code.md" >}}).

This posting is similar to "[Pulling data from the Warcraft Armory with Ruby]({{< relref "2010-05-09-ruby-and-armory.md" >}})" but with Groovy. For the people who are not familiar with [Groovy Home](http://groovy.codehaus.org) it's "Object-oriented language alternative for Java platform; Java-like syntax, dynamically compiles to JVM bytecodes" in other words it's another language that gets compiled to JVM bytecodes like [Jython](http://www.jython.org) (Python based) and [JRuby](http://jruby.org) (Ruby based), but unlike being based off another language, this is new take on the Java language. Groovy is also the key part in [Grails](http://www.grails.org) which is a [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) web framework like [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). Both Groovy and Grails aim to allow rapid development but still use enterprise standards Java technologies.

I love looking into and leaning a new language and for me the best way to learn is to redo something I already did in another language. This seem a bit pointless but for me I can see the key differences from one to the other.

This should output the list of characters in the guild that are level 80 by class. I did find working with XML in Groovy was a bit easier then Ruby. Overall, I find Groovy an interesting language and I do wish to learn more about it, along with Grails.


If any one knows of a better way to do this or any other language or technology that I should look into please let me know by posting a comment. Also feedback and questions are welcome!

**Update:**

Thanks to Guillaume Laforge there is a more 'groovify' example along with code to deal with character classes. Check it out at [http://groovyconsole.appspot.com/script/140001](http://groovyconsole.appspot.com/script/140001)
