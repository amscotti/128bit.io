Summary: A brief personal update about transitioning to a new job which has kept me busy and unable to write blog posts. Mentions acquiring O'Reilly videos on Mastering Grails 101 and Agile Engineering Practices to watch and review during the transition period.

So, as the title says, I've moved on to a new job. I've been focusing on learning things to help me at my new job, which hasn't really given me time to sit down and write a new posting for the blog. I'm sorry about this and I hope to have something soon after this transition period is over and things become normal for me.

I did get to buy some videos from O'Reilly, the "[Mastering Grails 101](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024798.do)" by Berglund and McCullough and "[Agile Engineering Practices](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020271.do)" by Neal Ford. I'm hoping to sit down and watch them this weekend and maybe write up a review posting for them.
