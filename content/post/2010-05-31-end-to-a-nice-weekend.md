Ah, an end to a nice relaxing weekend! Had a good time out and I was also able to do some work around the house to making things look better. Also as always I enjoy spending time with my fiancée.

Took this photo from my phone (Nexus One), it came out pretty good but still wish I had my real camera on me. It was taken from the Salem Willows in Salem, Ma and its looking in to Beverly, Ma. Can't really see it but there is the Salem/Beverly bridge that I drive over daily to get to work.

Over all a great weekend! Hoping many more will follow!
